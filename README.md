ZScript vehicle for GZDoom

Welcome!

So uhm... you can drive a car!

This code is very messy, sorry for that. This was my first true ZScript mod, it was my experiment. I created this vehicle, but instead of using real maths and logic,
my method consisted of trial and error :D And it is visible on the result, I know there are countless things to improve in this project, however...
Then improve! It's about time. I uploaded it here so you can access it. I tell you what tutorials and things I used as reference, to create this:
